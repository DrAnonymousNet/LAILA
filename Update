#So, there has not been much change in LAILA'S code, 
#All i have been doing noe is debugging and commenting.
#I felt so lazy, I haven't added the virtual keyboard Mode.
#Also, I plan on making a body for LAILA, but so sad, I dont know 
#Anything about Arduino . But I have started learning it sha.
#Let aee how this works out
